# Traffic Signs Recognition 
### Introduction
This project aims to develop a system that can recognize and classify traffic signs from images or video feeds. The system utilizes computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms to analyze and interpret the visual information of traffic signs, enabling automated sign recognition.

### Requirements
To run this project, the following dependencies are required:

Python 3.7 or higher
OpenCV library
TensorFlow or PyTorch library
Numpy library
Matplotlib library
Dataset of labeled traffic sign images (German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark)
